kegg_reactome_wp	Here's the pathway diagram. In <b>WikiPathways</b> and <b>KEGG</b>, genes are colored according to their ranks in the genome. Red means higher rank towards upregulation, blue means lower rank towards downregulation. The darker the color, the stronger the regulation. In <b>Reactome</b>, leading edge genes are highlighted in red. Both <b>WikiPathways</b> and <b>Reactome</b> are interactive. Click on individual nodes to learn more about the genes and/or regulatory nodes.
