n1_1	Select the type of visualization you want here.
n1_2	Here are the filtering options. <br><br>Filters are applied dynamically to each dataset, yielding gene lists.<br><br>You can also filter manually by entering a list of genes.
	Start by applying filters and investigating intersections between datasets.
n2_4	Select an intersection of interest here; this will be used for subsequent visualizations. <br><br>Tip: Validate your selections by making sure that the number of entries below matches the corresponding count in the Venn diagram.
n2_4b	Here you can view the enrichment of words in the list of genes/terms.<br><br>1. Specify the separator. e.g. "KEGG_NUCLEOTIDE_EXCISION_REPAIR" will only be parsed if the separator provided is "_".<br>2. Provide a list of words to ignore (REGEX allowed). e.g. to ignore numbers, add [[:digit:]].<br><br>This function works best if terms are gene sets (ORA or GSEA output).
