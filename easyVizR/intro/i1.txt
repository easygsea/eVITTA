	In the <b>Select Intersection</b> tab, you can see how well your filtered gene lists overlap with each other. 
n_venn_ui	For a smaller n, the <b>Venn diagram</b> will show you visually how well your gene lists overlap. 
df_n_upset	The <b>UpSet plot</b> is a bar-like rendition of the gene list intersections. This is useful when n is large and the <b>Venn diagram</b> is no longer informative.
ins_table_panel	After viewing the charts above, you need to select an <b>intersection of interest</b> to view in detail.<br><br>By default, the overlap shared among all gene lists is selected.
ui_intersections	Using the <b>Venn</b> or <b>UpSet</b> plot as a guide, combine these options to select the <b>intersection of interest</b>. <br><br>Tip: check if the number of terms match the count value in the above plots.
ins_applytorv	Click this button to apply your selection. 
n_ins_tbl	Terms contained in the <b>intersection of interest</b> are shown here; these will be used for plotting visualizations in the next panel. <br><br>Note: You can change the <b>intersection of interest</b> any time during visualization. 
intersection_summary	If you are unsure how the <b>intersection of interest</b> is filtered, you can view the details in this summary.
n2_4b	If you are working with <b>gene sets</b> instead of genes, this widget will help you identify the most represented words in your <b>intersection of interest</b>, and generate a <b>wordcloud</b> based on the text enrichment.
customize_filters	You can change the <b>active filters</b> any time using the <b>Gene list filters</b> button.
view_genelists	You can view <b>active gene lists</b> using the <b>Gene lists</b> button.
enter_genes	You can also manually enter <b>a list of terms</b> to view them in the visualization. <br><br>Note: If terms are missing, remove all active filters and try again.
