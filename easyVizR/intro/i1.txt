element	intro
	In the <b>Select Intersection</b> tab, you can see how well your <b>filtered lists</b> overlap with each other. 
n_venn_ui	For a small number of gene lists (n < 6), the <b>Venn Diagram</b> is useful for visualizing intersections between gene lists.<br><br> Users can toggle between two versions of the diagram: <ol><li><strong>Basic</strong>&nbsp;renders a non-area-proportional Venn diagram with <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-35">VennDiagram</a>. However, with n>4, this plot may become convoluted.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Area-proportional</strong>&nbsp;renders an area-proportional euler diagram with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eulerr/index.html">eulerr</a>. Note: with n>3, some intersections may fail to render.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The number of terms not included in any gene list is shown on the bottom right.</p><p>By default, the intersection currently selected in <u>Intersection of Interest</u> is highlighted. </p>
venn_diagram_setting_button	The settings of Venn diagram.
venn_diagram_color_button	The color options of Venn diagram.
venn_diagram_download_button	The download options of Venn diagram.
df_n_upset	For a small number of gene lists (n < 6), UpSet plot (rendered with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870712/">UpSetR</a>) is also provided. <br><br>In the UpSet plot, set sizes are presented in bar format. Thus, it is a useful alternative to Venn and euler diagrams when they become uninformative.<br><br>By default, the intersection currently selected in Intersection of Interest is highlighted.
upset_diagram_setting_button	The settings of UpSet diagram.
upset_diagram_color_button	The color options of UpSet diagram.
upset_diagram_download_button	The download options of UpSet diagram.
ins_table_panel	After viewing the charts above, you need to select an <b>intersection of interest</b> to view in detail.<br><br>By default, the mutual overlap (i.e. TRUE for all) is selected.
ui_intersections	Using the <b>Venn</b> or <b>UpSet</b> plot as a guide, combine these options to select the <b>intersection of interest</b>. <br><br>Tip: check if the number of terms match the count value in the above plots.
ins_applytorv	Click this button to apply your selection. 
n_ins_tbl	Terms contained in the <b>intersection of interest</b> are shown here; these will be used for plotting visualizations in the next panel. <br><br>Note: You can change the <b>intersection of interest</b> any time during visualization. 
intersection_summary	If you are unsure how the <b>intersection of interest</b> is filtered, you can view the details in this summary.
intersection_table_setting_button	Select the table view.
intersection_table_color_button	Select the max string length for Name column.
n2_4b	If you are working with <b>gene sets</b> instead of genes, this widget will help you identify the most represented words in your <b>intersection of interest</b>, and generate a <b>wordcloud</b> based on the text enrichment.
intersection_table_download_button	Download the current intersection table.
data_options	You can change display options for easyGSEA outputs.
customize_filters	You can change the <b>active filters</b> any time using the <b>Apply filters</b> button.
view_genelists	You can view <b>active filtered lists</b> using the <b>View filtered lists</b> button.
enter_genes	You can also manually enter <b>a list of terms</b> to view them in the visualization. <br><br>Note: If terms are missing, remove all active filters and try again.
